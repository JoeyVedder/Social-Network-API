## Description
A RESTful API for a social network application built for a social media startup. The API is designed to handle large amounts of unstructured data using a NoSQL database (MongoDB), making it scalable and capable of handling extensive data interactions. This API supports CRUD operations for users, thoughts (posts), reactions, and friend lists, with routing designed for seamless testing in Insomnia.

## Installation

Clone the repo, run a npm install inside the terminal, and make sure MongoDB or Insomnia is downloaded.
